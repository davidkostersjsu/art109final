      My final project is the result of introspection. As this is my final semester and I’m graduating, I wanted to create a rather narcissistic piece focused on presenting my work. This virtual gallery space sees users entering a gallery of some work I’ve created during my time at San Jose State University. While browsing the work, users will find themselves accompanied by admirer’s of my work. These admirers are none other than myself, who look at each piece with thought and appreciation. GALLERY OF ME is the manifestation of a large ego, building and growing stronger regardless of what the subject of the work is. The most important aspect of the gallery is not the artwork, but the fact that the artwork was made by one person: me. As a graduating art student, I feel that many artists don’t look at their work in a positive light. While I don’t believe everyone should be a narcissist about their work, I think it’s important to recognize your achievements and give yourself praise for what you’ve learned along your journey, and to remember that sometimes it’s all about you.
